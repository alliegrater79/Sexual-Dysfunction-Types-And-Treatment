# Sexual-Dysfunction-Types-And-Treatment
Sexual dysfunction is an issue that can occur at any time during the sexual response cycle, and it hinders you from getting pleasure from sexual activities. <br>

Traditionally, the sexual response cycle involves excitation, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. Desire and arousal are both components of the sexual response's excitement phase. It's crucial to note that women don't always go through these stages in the same sequence.<br>

While evidence indicates that sexual dysfunction is prevalent, many people are uncomfortable discussing it. However, while therapeutic alternatives exist, you should consult your concerns with your spouse and healthcare practitioner.<br>

Reasons for Sexual Dysfunction and Disorders<br>

Sexual dysfunction is frequently caused by stress. Other factors include:<br>

•	sexual trauma<br>
•	psychological issues<br>
•	diabetes<br>
•	heart disease or other medical conditions<br>
•	drug or alcohol use<br>
•	certain medications<br>
•	low libido <br>

For those with female reproductive organs, other contributing factors include:<br>

•	hormonal changes following childbirth<br>
•	breast-feeding<br>
•	menopause<br>
Other causes include:<br>

•	high blood pressure<br>
•	diabetes<br>
•	certain medications<br>
•	relationship problems<br>
•	sexual inhibitions<br>
•	stress<br>
•	fatigue<br>
•	fear of pregnancy<br>

Sexual Dysfunction Types and Treatment<br>

Sexual dysfunction is often divided into four categories:<br>

•	Desire disorders are characterised by a lack of sexual desire or interest in sex.<br>
•	Arousal problems are characterised by an inability to get physically aroused or enthusiastic during the sexual engagement.<br>
•	Orgasm problems include the delay or lack of orgasm (climax).<br>
•	Pain disorders: discomfort during intercourse.<br>

Sexual dysfunction in penises: Ejaculation disorders<br>
Impotence (erectile dysfunction) is the inability to obtain and maintain an adequate hard erection for intercourse.<br>

Having occasional erection problems isn't usually a reason for alarm. Having erectile dysfunction regularly can create stress, impact your self-confidence, and lead to relationship troubles. Problems obtaining or maintaining an erection can also indicate an underlying health problem that requires treatment and a risk factor for heart disease.<br>

Talk to your doctor if you're worried about erectile dysfunction, even if you're ashamed. Treating an underlying issue might sometimes be enough to reverse erectile dysfunction, and medication or other direct therapies may be required in other circumstances.<br>

Sexual dysfunction in vaginas:<br>
1.	Pain and discomfort<br>
Several factors might induce discomfort during sexual activity. Penetration is uncomfortable due to insufficient lubrication and stiff vaginal muscles. Intercourse can be painful due to involuntary vaginal muscular spasms, or vaginismus. These might be signs of the neurological, urinary tract, or gastrointestinal problems.<br>

Menopause's hormonal changes can make intercourse painful. A decrease in oestrogen levels can cause skin thinning in the vaginal region, and it can also cause the vaginal lining to weaken and reduce lubrication.<br>

2.	Difficulty having an orgasm <br>
Orgasm's adversaries include stress and exhaustion, and pain and discomfort are also common during the sexual engagement. Orgasm may be impossible if your sex desire is low or your hormones are out of balance.<br>

Diagnosis of Sexual Dysfunction And Disorders<br>
In most circumstances, you understand that something is interfering with your enjoyment (or your partner's enjoyment) of a sexual connection. A comprehensive history of symptoms and a physical examination are generally the first steps taken by your physician. They may arrange diagnostic testing to rule out any medical issues causing the malfunction. In most cases, lab testing has a minor role in diagnosing sexual dysfunction.<br>

An assessment of sexual attitudes, as well as other potential contributing factors such as fear, anxiety, past sexual trauma/abuse, relationship concerns, medications, alcohol or drug abuse, and so on, assists a clinician in understanding the underlying cause of the problem and recommending the best treatment.<br>

Remember that sexual dysfunction is just an issue if it concerns you. There is no need for therapy if it does not annoy you.<br>

Because there are so many different symptoms and causes of female sexual dysfunction, therapy differs. You must express your worries and understand your body and its typical sexual reaction. Your sex life objectives are also vital for selecting a treatment and determining whether or not it is working for you.<br>

Women with sexual problems frequently benefit from a multifaceted therapy strategy that addresses medical, relational, and emotional difficulties.<br>
Most kinds of sexual dysfunction are treatable by addressing the underlying medical or psychological issues. Other therapeutic options include:<br>

•	Medicine: If a prescription is the source of the problem, changing the medication may be beneficial.<br>

•	Mechanical aids, such as suction devices and penile implants, may benefit males suffering from erectile dysfunction (the inability to achieve or maintain an erection).<br>

•	Sex therapy: Sex therapists can help persons with sexual difficulties that their main clinician cannot handle. Therapists are frequently effective marriage counsellors.<br>

•	Behavioural treatments: These include a variety of strategies, such as insights into damaging behaviours in the relationship or procedures, such as self-stimulation for the treatment of arousal and/or orgasm difficulties.<br>

•	Psychotherapy: Working with a qualified counsellor can help you deal with prior sexual trauma, emotions of worry, dread, guilt, and poor body image. All of these things may have an impact on sexual function.<br>

•	Education and communication: Learning about sex and sexual actions and responses might help you overcome sexual function fears. Open communication with your spouse about your needs and worries also aids in the removal of many obstacles to good sex life.<br>
